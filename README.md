## üöÄ Projects  

### üîπ [Network Intrusion Detection System](https://github.com/uday1o1/NIDS.git) (Ongoing)
Building a **multi-stage ML-based intrusion detection system** using **flow-level features** with **Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression**. The first stage separates normal from malicious traffic, while the second categorizes attacks (DoS, DDoS, Web, Infiltration) to enable targeted defenses.  

### üîπ [DeepShield](https://github.com/uday1o1/DeepShield.git) (Ongoing)
DeepShield is a **chrome extension** that uses onnxruntime-web (WebGPU/WASM) with **MediaPipe** face detection and a quantized **PyTorch-trained** ONNX model to **detect deepfakes in real time** directly in the browser via tab capture, with no external servers.
### üîπ [Autonomous Cleaning Robot Development](https://github.com/uday1o1/auto_clean_robot.git)
Developed the **computer vision module** for an autonomous cleaning robot, creating a **custom Roboflow dataset** (home objects, waste, spills, people, pets) and benchmarking **six deep learning models** (YOLOv8, EfficientDet, Faster R-CNN, SSD, DETR, InceptionV3). Produced a working prototype capable of detecting obstacles and unclean areas, with findings documented in a research paper (under review).

### üîπ [Delhi Heatwave Predictor](https://github.com/uday1o1/delhi-heatwave-predictor.git)  
Built a **multi-horizon LSTM model** in **PyTorch** to forecast **1‚Äì7 day heatwave spells** in Delhi using open-source NASA POWER weather data. Implemented automated preprocessing, per-horizon threshold tuning, and a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive forecasts, data coverage, and visualization.

### üîπ [Automatic ECG Diagnosis](https://github.com/uday1o1/ecg_project)  
Implemented a deep residual neural network in **PyTorch** for multi-label classification of **12-lead ECGs** from the CODE-15% dataset, with end-to-end workflows for data preparation, training, thresholding, evaluation, and visualization.
