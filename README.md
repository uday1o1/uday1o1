## 🚀 Projects  

### 🔹 [Network Intrusion Detection System](https://github.com/uday1o1/NIDS.git) (Ongoing)
Building a **multi-stage ML-based intrusion detection system** using **flow-level features** with **Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression**. The first stage separates normal from malicious traffic, while the second categorizes attacks (DoS, DDoS, Web, Infiltration) to enable targeted defenses.  

### 🔹 [Autonomous Cleaning Robot Development](https://github.com/uday1o1/auto_clean_robot.git)
Developed the **computer vision module** for an autonomous cleaning robot, creating a **custom Roboflow dataset** (home objects, waste, spills, people, pets) and benchmarking **six deep learning models** (YOLOv8, EfficientDet, Faster R-CNN, SSD, DETR, InceptionV3). Produced a working prototype capable of detecting obstacles and unclean areas, with findings documented in a research paper (under review).

### 🔹 [DeepShield](https://github.com/uday1o1/DeepShield.git)
DeepShield is a **Chrome extension** that uses onnxruntime-web (WebGPU/WASM), OpenCV.js/MediaPipe, and a **PyTorch** trained ONNX model to detect **deepfakes** in real time directly in the browser with **no external servers**.

### 🔹 [Heat Impact Prediction](https://github.com/uday1o1/heat-impact-prediction.git)
Developed a **CNN–LSTM model** in **TensorFlow/Keras** to predict extreme heat events using spatial, temporal, and environmental data. Built a vulnerability index linking forecasts with social impact.

### 🔹 [ECG Signal Analysis](https://github.com/uday1o1/ecg-signal-analysis)  
Designed anomaly detection and classification workflows in **Python** for **MIT-BIH ECG data**, using modular, object-oriented components for segmentation, feature extraction, and evaluation.
