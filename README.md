## 🚀 Projects  

### 🔹 Network Intrusion Detection System (Ongoing)  
Developing a **two-stage ML-based intrusion detection system** for flood-based attacks using **flow-level features** with different **supervised learning** algorithms. Stage 1 classifies traffic as Normal or Flood, while Stage 2 distinguishes between DoS and DDoS for precise mitigation.  

### 🔹 Autonomous Cleaning Robot Development  
Implemented a perception module with **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV** for object detection, and integrated **SLAM** within the **ROS framework** for navigation and mapping, delivering a functional prototype robot.  

### 🔹 Heat Impact Prediction  
Developed a **CNN–LSTM model** in **TensorFlow/Keras** to predict extreme heat events using spatial, temporal, and environmental data. Built a vulnerability index linking forecasts with social impact.  

### 🔹 DeepShield  
Created a **Chrome extension** for real-time **deepfake detection** on Twitter and YouTube using **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV**. Implemented on-device inference with **Python and JavaScript**, enabling instant detection and alerts without external servers.  

### 🔹 ECG Signal Analysis  
Designed anomaly detection and classification workflows in **Python** for **ECG time-series data** to support healthcare monitoring. Built modular, object-oriented components for feature extraction and analysis.
